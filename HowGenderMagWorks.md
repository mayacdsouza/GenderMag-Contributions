<h1>How does GenderMag make software more inclusive?</h1>

Gender Mag Recorders Assistant walks people through how to analyze their website based on different personas. These personas are created by considering 5 cognitive style facets. Each of these facets is a spectrum, and every person can have tendencies to fall in a certain part of the spectrum based on their specific personality and the use case.

While each individual can be at different points on these spectrums, there are some gender differences on where men and women are more likely to fall on the spectrums. As a result, analyzing different personas can be a way to help understand how a range of diverse users can use a program differently and have different needs and wants when using a program. Considering this whole range can thus lead to more gender-inclusive (and overall inclusive) software.
