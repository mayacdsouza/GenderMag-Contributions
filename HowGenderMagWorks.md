<h1>How does GenderMag make software more inclusive?</h1>

Gender Mag Recorders Assistant walks people through how to analyze their website based on different personas. These personas are created by considering 5 cognitive style facets. Each of these facets is a spectrum, and every person can have tendencies to fall in a certain part of the spectrum based on their specific personality and the use case.

The five facets are...

GenderMag uses 3 different personalities to help analyze software that fall onto different parts of each spectrum.

While each individual can be at different points on these spectrums, there are some gender differences on where men and women are more likely to fall on the spectrums. As a result, analyzing different personas can be a way to help understand how a range of diverse users can use a program differently and have different needs and wants when using a program. Considering this whole range can thus lead to more gender-inclusive (and overall inclusive) software.

GenderMag Recorders Assistant is a semi-automated tool that helps users walk through their software in the mindset of each of the personas and consider how they would each use the software. As a result, creators can find areas where their software only caters to part of the spectrum on each of the five cognitive style facets and address these issues to make the software more inclusive.

<h1>Examples of How to Cater to People with a Range of Cognitive Facets</h1>

<h4>Example 1 - Motivations:</h4> Explaining the pros and cons of using different features can help users regardless of where they fall on the spectrum of motivations. Users who are solely interested in completing a task can quickly discern the relevant features to use and users with a tech interest can quickly determine which features interest them.

<h4>Example 2 - Attitude Toward Risk:</h4> A message pop up asking the user if they are sure they wish to delete a file before doing so to make sure they do not accidentally lose data can prevent risk takers from accidentally deleting files. A guide explaining what happens when a user switches to the new version of a software could help a risk-averse person decide if they wish to make the change.

<h4>Example 3 - Learning Style:</h4> Guides showing how to complete relevant tasks on the website such as a set of written instructions, an FAQs page, or a video walkthrough can help people who are process-oriented learners. In order to also appeal to tinkerers, these guides can be optional. For example, there could be a popup the first time a user logins asking if they would like to go through the guides or proceed straight to the homepage.
