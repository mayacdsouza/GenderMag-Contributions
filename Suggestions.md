<h1>Suggestions for improvement to GenderMag Recorder’s assistant based on walking through the tool:</h1>

1. The tool allows you to choose the persona and pronouns and then uses them accordingly in the walkthrough, but it uses incorrect conjugations. For example, instead of “she has” vs. “they have”, the tool automatically uses have. The conjugations could also be customized based on the pronouns used.

2. The tool creates a spreadsheet output to download results. The output could be improved in the following ways to make the downloaded information easier to understand:
  
        a. Image names could be added to the spreadsheet so it’s easier to find them in the separate folder.
        b. Format of each goal and action could be displayed more cleanly. Here is an example of this:
3. Users could be allowed to create all actions and goals upfront.
4. There could be clearer documentation for allowing users to associate subgoals with actions.
5. The tool could come with an initial walkthrough (or a link to one on the GenderMag website) showing someone using the tool and verbalizing how to do so and why they are choosing options to help users more quickly understand how to use the tool and allow them to do so more effectively with this understanding.
6. When choosing a persona, the following text could be shown in the dropdown (taken from the GenderMag Project website). Instead of only showing names and using a link to go to the project website, having both the link and these descriptions will enable users to get a quick understanding if they are someone who won’t have interest in going to the website link and reading a longer article.
 
        Tim -  facet values are those most frequently seen in men
        Abi - facet values most frequently seen in women that are the most different from Tim
        Pat - facet values add coverage of a large fraction of people different from both Abi and Tim
7. When selecting the facets in the tool, there could be concise descriptions instead of links to longer ones. This would help users learn the personas faster and also appeal to users who are not willing to read longer descriptions. For example, the motivations link for Abi (she/her) could become: 
Proficient with technologies she uses
Only learns new technologies if needed
